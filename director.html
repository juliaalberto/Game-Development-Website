<h2> Other Descriptions</h2>
<p class = "text" style = "text-align: center">
    <br> Some of their tasks are between the game producers and the game designers. But their work load all depends on how big the gaming company is and what kind of project the person is currently working on. If one is working for a small company or with a small project, the director might take the position(s) of the designer, director, and/or producer for that one project. </br>
 <br>Nevertheless, game directors usually manage the design team, act as the creativity designer, and create the grand-scale design trajectories. Some other responsibilities involve consulting with video game publishers, leading the team meetings, and hiring game developers.</br>
 <br>Overall, the main purpose of the job is to check all the aspects of the game development, from start to finish with the director's perfect vision of the final product.</br>

<h2> How it connects to CS?</h2>

They would need to understand the situation and possibly even some coding programs in order to communicate with the whole team. Just like any kind of director, they would need great communication and knowledge of the whole gaming production in order to create their vision of the video game.
