<h2> Other Descriptions</h2>

<p class = "text" style = "text-align: center">
 <br>While the minimum requirement to be a game designer is only a high school diploma, designers may need to get their bachelor's degree, especailly if they are planning to work for big gaming companies. They may need to have some experience working in computer science, programming or art to create the visuals as planned. </br>
 <br>Game designers would also need to tell a story, work as a team and work for many hours seated, looking at a computer monitor all day and night. Additionally, they would need to have common knowledge of programming languages, software, and 3D modeling programs and a passion and experience in video gaming.</br>

        <h2> How it connects to CS?</h2>
        <p class = "text"></p>
<p class = "text" style="text-align:center">
    Game designers use computer science because they have to stick to the limitations of the hardware. They need to make sure that whatever they design is possible for the rest of the team to make. If the designs does not work, they would have to find an alternative of how they can change their design so it falls within the limitations of the hardware without changing it drastically from the original idea.
