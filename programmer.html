<h2> Other Descriptions</h2>
<p class = "text" style = "text-align: center">
<br>Video game programmers have the option to get a bachelor's degree in either information systems, computer science or mathematics to learn programming languages, operatoin sytems, and advanced math. However, most video game programmers stick with a specialized type of programming, which allows them to focus their skills and to work in a collaborative development process with the whole team. </br>
<br> The types of game programmers are audio engineers, network programmers,graphics programmers and programmers/engineers.

<h2> How it connects to CS?</h2>
<p class = "text" style = "text-align: center"></p>

       <p class = "text" style="text-align:center">
           Programmers use computer science in their work because they have to translate what the designers write into the code. They get a task from the designer or the director to write and decide which code would be the most fun for players and the least taxing on the hardware. And if any bugs appear, they have to first find out what the problem is, then fix it in a way that doesn't break anything else.
